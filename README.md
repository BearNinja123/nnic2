# nnic2
A complete redesign of my original nnic repo since the code was pretty bad

Now with proper header files and a makefile!

Now with a flexible amount of layers!

Now with configurable activations!

We even have Adam and it trains on MNIST instead of some random toy dataset!

run ```chmod u+x install_mnist.sh && ./install_mnist.sh```, then ```make``` and then ```./nnic``` to run.
